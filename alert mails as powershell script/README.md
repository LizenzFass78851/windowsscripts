## alert mails as powershell script
- this script sends alert mails when a defined trigger informs an event log of what occurs in windows.
- The parameters for reacting to the desired event log must be adjusted in the powershell script and in the task scheduler (see the template to be found here for importing.)
- Other parameters for sending with the smtp server, ssl and more must be edited in the powershell script.
