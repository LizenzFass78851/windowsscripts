## scripts for install .net framework of install-dvd
- insert the installation dvd for the installed windows version and execute the script, the script searches the dvd and installs the net framework for windows 8.1, 10 and 11 and corresponding server variants from the dvd

> [!NOTE]
> This applies to .NET Framework version 3.5

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **These scripts works only on windows 8.1 up to windows 11 25H2**
> 
> Newer versions of windows 11 (e.g windows 11 26H1 and newer) are not working because an addional install setup was needed (It's kind of the same as with Windows 7.)
